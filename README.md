**First commit**

- data/tagsCleaning
  : extraction of emotional tags from LastFM tags ([WNAffect](https://github.com/clemtoy/WNAffect/tree/master) needed)

- data/transferLearning
  : fine-tuning of BERT-derived model for emotion classification on sourceDataset (Edmonds Dance Dataset)

- baselines/LDA.ipynb
  : Latent Dirichlet Allocation (inspired by [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9440333))

- baselines/NNs
  : CNN, biLSTM and CRNN implemented as suggested by [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8999294); choice between the models and editing of parameters can be done in NNs/Configuration.py
